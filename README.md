# FAQ
1. I keep getting output, but the article is fine. What do I do?
  - Nothing. This is meant to be a suggestion and bring your attention to something. If a rule exists you should review it 
  and see if it applies to you. If it is non negotiable then its returned as an error. 
2. I want to make a new rule or changes.
  - Review the Vale docs. Mostly https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/styles#introduction and https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/markup#available-scopes. Also look at the third party resources for inspiration. https://github.com/errata-ai/styles
